# Galaxy Web Similarity Search

Welcome to the SDSS Galaxy Similarity Search repository. This project enables you to search for similar galaxies within the (Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS))[https://classic.sdss.org/] based on user-provided coordinates (ra/dec) or by selecting from one of our pre-set example images. Harness the power of astronomy and machine learning to explore the universe - right from your web browser, with no installation required!

The application utilizes TensorFlow.js, a JavaScript library for training and deploying machine learning models in the browser. This allows for the heavy computation to be done right in your browser, providing a seamless experience. **No need for a backend** 

### Getting Started

### Disclaimer

Please note that this web application is quite resource-intensive. Therefore, it may not work as intended on mobile devices or older computers. The first initial load of the application may also take some time due to the loading of the machine learning model and galaxy data.
